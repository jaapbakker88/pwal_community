          Linda, Linda, Linda - where to start? Definitely one of the most active locals, she always has a way of finding the right place at the right time and manages to make small fun become big fun. With an absolutely positive and infectious personality, Linda is well worth a message.

          Always up for a good time and lots of laughs. Whether it's a chilled brunch, some outdoor activities or a full on night out, Baiba is always so much fun. She has a great sense of direction too and knows the city. Good to have on your team.

          Anna is super open and very nice. We went to a quiet party where she was the DJ. She got me in for free and introduced me to her friends. 100% recommendable!

          Brent is Melbourne\'s Super Hero... I mean Local. Soon he\'ll have the keys to the city or at least have a statue built in his honor. Brent knows how to have a good laugh and not take things too seriously. He\'s very welcoming to all - and gives up a lot of his time to others.
